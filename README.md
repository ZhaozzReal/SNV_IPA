# SNV_IPA

## Description
Somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in cancer genome affect gene expression through various mechanisms depending on their genomic location. In this study, we found that somatic SNVs near splice site are associated with abnormal intronic polyadenylation (IpA). Here we show how to perform SNV-associated IpA analysis through an example (*GRHL2*).
